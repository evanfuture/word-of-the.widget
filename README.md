## In Action

In order to use, you have to [get your own API Key for WordsAPI from Mashape][3].  The service requires you to put down a credit card, but the free tier is generous, at *2500* requests per day.

Once you have that, fill in the options at the top of the word-of-the.coffee file.

Also: The Synonyms and Similar-To's are clickable, and will switch to the new word!
